# OpenGL House Shape Project

This project demonstrates how to draw a simple **house-shaped polygon** using OpenGL with GLFW and GLAD. The shape consists of a triangle (roof) and a square (body), rendered in **cyan** color on a **white** background.

## Technologies Used

- C++
- OpenGL 3.3 Core
- GLFW (for window creation and input)
- GLAD (for OpenGL function loading)

## Features

- Renders a cyan pentagon resembling a house.
- White background for better visibility.
- Uses custom shaders (vertex and fragment).
- Clean and simple rendering pipeline.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have:
   - `GLFW`
   - `GLAD`
   - OpenGL-compatible environment
2. Compile the program using your preferred compiler.
3. Run the executable. A window titled **"Md Abir Hasan"** will appear showing the cyan house shape.
